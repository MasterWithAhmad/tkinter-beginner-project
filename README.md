# Tkinter Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python applications built using the Tkinter framework. These projects are designed to help you understand and practice intermediate-level concepts in GUI (Graphical User Interface) development with Tkinter.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Calculator with History**
A simple yet functional calculator that tracks calculation history. You can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while also viewing a history of your calculations.

### 2. **Advanced To-Do List with Persistence**
An advanced to-do list that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The list is saved locally, so tasks persist even after closing the application. Features include task categorization and task status (completed/incomplete).

### 3. **Customizable Digital Clock**
A digital clock with options to change the format (12-hour or 24-hour), font style, and background color. It displays the current time and updates in real-time.

### 4. **Real-Time Currency Converter**
A currency converter that retrieves live exchange rates from an API. Users can convert amounts between various currencies and see real-time conversion rates.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- `requests` library (for the Currency Converter project)

You can install the `requests` library using pip if you don't have it installed:

```bash
pip install requests
```
### Running the Projects

#### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/MasterWithAhmad/tkinter-beginner-project.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the repository folder:
```
cd tkinter-beginner-project
```

#### 3. Run the desired Python file. For example, to run the calculator project:
```
python calculator.py
```
Similarly, you can run any of the other applications.
